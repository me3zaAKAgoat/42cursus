- add another check for when the two first numbers (or last and first) should be swapped to avoid pushing to b and pushing back to a instead of a simple swap
- I am not so sure we need to set the smallest number at the first index before we check for the longest increasing subsquence (need testing)
- spree to reduce duplicated code!!
- do a check where the program keeps rotating the sequence until it finds the the sequence for which the LIS is maxed out
- look into checking if there are numbers that could be swapped with sa and sb before pushing to b then back to a
- Taking up the example in the section above, it goes without saying that 4 0 becomes less convenient than 3 2, as for the first 4 moves are performed while for the second 3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- there's a fatal error in my output as for every rrr and rr i print ra rb rr and rra rrb rrr
- have a find best move function for kicking elements that dont belong to LIS from A to B but efficiently
