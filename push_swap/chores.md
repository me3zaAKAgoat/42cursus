- add another check for when the two first numbers (or last and first) should be swapped to avoid pushing to b and pushing back to a instead of a simple swap
- I am not so sure we need to set the smallest number at the first index before we check for the longest increasing subsquence (need testing)
- spree to reduce duplicated code!!
- do a check where the program keeps rotating the sequence until it finds the the sequence for which the LIS is maxed out
