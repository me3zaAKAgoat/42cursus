should remove duplicated code in r-a and r-b and make an r function that takes in which stack it affects!!
should make a structure that holds meta data like the stacks a and b
add another check for when the two first numbers (or last and first) should be swapped to avoid pushing to b and pushing back to a instead of a simple swap
I am not so sure we need to set the smallest number at the first index before we check for the longest increasing subsquence (need testing)
spree to reduce duplicated code!!
